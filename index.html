<h1>About me</h1>

  I am a double-degree student at KTH Royal Insitute of Technology and UPC BarcelonaTech,
   enrolled in the MSc in Electrical and Telecommunications engineering  respectively.
</p>

<p>
  Right now, I am at the National Institute of Informatics in Tokyo, Japan,
  working on my Master's Thesis in the field of Deep Learning for Computer Vision and
  focusing on light-weight, multi-task architectures for real-time,
   embeddable applications, such as Dynamic Map Creation from UAV imagery.

  Previously, I interned at Intermodalics working on Mobile Robotics and at Everis doing Big Data.
