<h1>About me</h1>

  I wrote my Master's thesis at the National Institute of Informatics in Tokyo, Japan, working in the field of Deep Learning for Computer Vision and focusing on the development of light-weight, multi-task architectures for real-time, embedded applications. Find it here: LINKKKKKK
