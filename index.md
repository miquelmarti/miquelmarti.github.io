# About me

I am a research intern at the National Institute of Informatics of Japan. Currently working on my Master's Thesis in the field of Deep Learning for Computer Vision and with a strong focus on real-time, embeddable applications such as Dynamic Map Creation from UAVs.

I am enrolled in a double-degree program at KTH Royal Insitute of Technology and Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya, working towards the MSc in Electrical and Telecommunications engineering respectively. In the past, I specialized in networked systems while lately my interests moved towards Robotics, Computer Vison and Deep Learning.

Previously, I have worked as an intern at Intermodalics, doing Mobile Robotics and Manipulation and at Everis Big Data Center of Excellence.
